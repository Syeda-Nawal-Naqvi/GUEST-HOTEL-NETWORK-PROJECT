# GUEST-HOTEL-NETWORK-PROJECT
The Hotel Guest Wi-Fi Network project created a secure Wi-Fi system using Cisco Packet Tracer. We installed access points, set up a captive portal for guest authentication, and isolated the guest network from staff. Thorough testing ensured reliable connectivity and enhanced security for an improved guest experience.
